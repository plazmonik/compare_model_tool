# compare_model_tool
Tool to make a visualisatio of feature importances comparation for two data models. 
Creation was initiated on Visualizing Machine Learning 3: cowork/minihackathon by idea of Przemys≈Çaw Biecek.

Usage: Main function is hidden in the app.py file by the name: 
two_model_feature_importance_app
Run iris_example and then titanic_example to see the visualisations, and inspect their code for an implementation. 

To do list:
1. make it a package
2. check behaviour of the more featured-heavy dataset
3. implement interface to work with more feature importances method.
